Spectral Forecast in JS, C#, Python, PHP, VB

This Javascript project uses my own mathematical model published in the journal Chaos. The model is called Spectral Forecast. The Spectral Forecast equation is a part of the Spectral Forecast model and it was initially used on matrices. It can also be used on other multidimensional mathematical objects. Here, a novel utility is demonstrated for signals by using the equation on vectors. This new use on 1-dimensional objects was published here. Waveform mixing with Spectral Forecast in JS - is a demo application designed in Javascript, that is able to mix two signals (A and B) in arbitrary proportions. Different cases can be seen, with two different waveform signals that are combined depending on a value d, called a distance. This distance d is defined from zero to the maximum value found above the two vectors that represent these signals. The two HTML files (index.html and waveform mixing with Spectral Forecast.html) have the same content. The presence of the index.html file is required for the live demo (Github specific). Here's how to use the Spectral Forecast equation to combine two waveforms:
