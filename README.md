# Spectral Forecast in JS, C#, Py, PHP, VB, Pl, Rb, Java

This project uses my own mathematical model published in the journal [Chaos](https://doi.org/10.1063/1.5120818). The model is called Spectral Forecast. The Spectral Forecast equation is a part of the Spectral Forecast model and it was initially used on matrices. It can also be used on other multidimensional mathematical objects. Here, a novel utility is demonstrated for signals by using the equation on vectors. This new use on 1-dimensional objects was published [here](https://www.wiley.com/en-us/Algorithms+in+Bioinformatics:+Theory+and+Implementation-p-9781119697961). <i>Combining-two-signals-in-JS-C-Py-PHP-VB-Pl-Rb</i> - is a demo implementation designed in seven different programming / scripting languages, namely C#, Python, VB6, Javascript, Perl, Ruby and PHP. Each implementation is able to mix two signals / vectors (<i>A</i> and <i>B</i>) in arbitrary proportions. The signals are combined depending on a value <i>d</i>, called a distance. Distance <i>d</i> was arbitrary chosen (<i>d</i>=33) between zero and <i>Max(d)</i>. Where <i>Max(d)</i> is defined from zero to the maximum value found above the two vectors that represent these signals.
